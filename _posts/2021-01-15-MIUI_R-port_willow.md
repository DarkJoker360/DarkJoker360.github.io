This is an unofficial port or xiaomi.eu beta from Redmi Note 8 based on Miui 12.x Android 11.
Everything is working fine except nfc, which I didn't look at how can it be added.
My builds don't have firmware, so you can't brick your phone, also they are tested before relase.


**What's not working :**

 * NFC

**Instructions :**

 * Download the latest build

 * Reboot to recovery

 * Flash the latest build

 * Boot

 NOTE: if at first boot you face sim, wifi and other thing crashing just don't panic and finish installation steps.

 * Reboot to recovery
 
 * Flash willow-firmware

 * Reboot
